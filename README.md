# Home Assistant Addon

I made this repo because I often need to change some (little) things to adapt an addon to suit my needs.

## Addon list
There is nothing here, or at leats for now. ;)

## How to use
Add my repo link to hassio addon store.

## Notes
If you want to suggest somethings related to addons, please make pull request to addon creator because the most of the latter are forked.
Obviously that's applied only for forked addon, if I create my own addon any suggestions will be welcome.
